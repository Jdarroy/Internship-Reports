Scripts often are used to automate tedious tasks, like renaming a lot of files
in a folder to correspond to a certain pattern. Scripting is very usefull and
programmers know it and are fond of them. But what if you could script your
favorite Java IDE, Eclipse, to automate tasks like setting up a project or
creating Readme files for all projects in the Workspace? Well you actually can.

Using a plugin called EASE, you can EASEly script Eclipse using your favorite
script language, like Javascript or Python. You could even code and add your
own Module to EASE to further enhance you and the community's scripting
experience.

Try it out by installing
[EASE](http://download.eclipse.org/ease/update/release), but take care not
trying to automate everything, or you will end up coding more scripts than
actually getting work done.
